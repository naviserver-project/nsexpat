	* nsexpat.c: Fixed all warnings by adding (int) and (XML_*) casts to

    	name, TclExpatUnparsedEntityDeclHandler.

	* nsexpat.c: changed include expat.h to xmlparse.h. There isn't
	any expat.h. It compiles and loads without complaint!

	* Makefile: brought into compliance with standard way of doing
	AOLserver module makefiles.

	* nsexpat: God, am I going to try and maintain this module too?
